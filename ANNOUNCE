			   Fectors for Vicare
			   ==================


Functional  programming needs  functional data  structures.  This  is an
implementation of "vectors" (also called  arrays), a finite map keyed by
consecutive  integers between  0  and n-1,  n being  the  length of  the
vector.  Being  functional, the  structure is not  observably mutatable,
and so access to any version will always give the correct answer.

  "Fectors for Vicare" is just a repackaging of Ian Price's Fectors with
GNU Autotools for package infrastructure and verified support for Vicare
Scheme.

  The home page of the Vicare project is at:

	       <http://marcomaggi.github.io/vicare.html>

  The latest version of Fectors for Vicare Scheme can be found here:

	  <https://bitbucket.org/marcomaggi/fectors/downloads>

development takes place at:

		<http://github.com/marcomaggi/fectors/>

in the "vicare-scheme" branch; and as backup at:

	      <https://bitbucket.org/marcomaggi/fectors/>

the documentation is available online:
