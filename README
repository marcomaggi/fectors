1. Introduction
---------------

Functional  programming needs  functional data  structures.  This  is an
implementation of "vectors" (also called  arrays), a finite map keyed by
consecutive  integers between  0  and n-1,  n being  the  length of  the
vector.  Being  functional, the  structure is not  observably mutatable,
and so access to any version will always give the correct answer.

  There are many  possible implementations of the  vector interface with
different  efficiency  characteristics,  the one  contained  prioritises
"single threaded" use  of vectors, that is, one in  which access is most
frequently  to  the last  created  version  of  the vector.   Access  to
previously stored versions works correctly,  though it will not be quite
as efficient.

  This package  is just a  repackaging of  Ian Price's Fectors  with GNU
Autotools  for package  infrastructure and  verified support  for Vicare
Scheme.

  *NOTE*  The  maintainer of  this  repackaging  supports only  the  GNU
infrastructure and tests only on a GNU+Linux system.


2. License
----------

See the LICENSE file.


3. Install
----------

Before installing Fectors make sure to have a correctly installed Vicare
Scheme.

  To install Fectors  from a proper release tarball, we  must unpack the
archive then do:

   $ cd fectors-0.4.0
   $ mkdir build
   $ cd build
   $ ../configure
   $ make
   $ make check
   $ make install

notice  that  the  "configure"  script  is  prepared  to  enable  shared
libraries  and  disable static  libraries:  this  must not  be  changed,
because  the package  is  meant to  install  a C  shared  library to  be
dynamically loaded.

  The Makefile is designed to allow parallel builds, so we can do:

   $ make -j4 all && make -j4 check

which,  on  a  4-core  CPU,   should  speed  up  building  and  checking
significantly.


  To test what a rule will do use the "-n" option; example:

    $ make install -n

  The "Makefile" supports the  "DESTDIR" environment variable to install
the files under a temporary location; example:

    $ make install DESTDIR=/tmp/fectors

  If, instead,  we have checked out  a revision from the  repository, we
will have  to first build the  infrastructure running a script  from the
top source directory:

   $ cd fectors
   $ sh autogen.sh

notice that "autogen.sh" will run the program "autoreconf".

  After this the  procedure is the same  as the one for  building from a
proper release tarball, but we have to enable maintainer mode:

    $ ../configure --enable-maintainer-mode [options]
    $ make
    $ make check
    $ make install

  Libraries are installed under the directory:

			$(libdir)/vicare-scheme

on 32-bit platforms we should arrange such library to be:

		      $(prefix)/lib/vicare-scheme

on 64-bit platforms we should arrange such library to be:

		     $(prefix)/lib64/vicare-scheme

  The variable VFLAGS is available  to the user when running "configure"
and "make" to add command line options to the execution of "vicare" when
compiling libraries and running tests; for example:

   $ make VFLAGS="-g -O2 --option print-loaded-libraries"
